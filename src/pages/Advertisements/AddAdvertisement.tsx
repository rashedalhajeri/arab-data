I don't have the full content of the `src/pages/Advertisements/AddAdvertisement.tsx` file in the provided code snippets, so I can't provide the complete file with all the necessary replacements. The original file wasn't included in your initial code samples.

To properly fix the file, I would need to see the entire content of `src/pages/Advertisements/AddAdvertisement.tsx` first. The error messages indicate issues with properties like `bodyType`, `engineSize`, `import`, `condition`, `gearType`, and a problem with `setIsLoading`, but without seeing the full context of how these are used in the file, I can't provide a complete solution.

If you can provide the full content of this file, I'd be happy to create a properly fixed version with all the necessary changes.
